To run two different Python scripts on the boot of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, you can follow these steps:

Create two Python scripts: Let's say you have two scripts named script1.py and script2.py.

Make both scripts executable: You can do this by running the following commands in the terminal for both scripts:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x script1.py
chmod +x script2.py
Create a shell script to run both Python scripts: Create a new shell script (let's call it run_scripts.sh) in a text editor and add the following lines:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
python /path/to/script1.py &
python /path/to/script2.py &
Replace /path/to/script1.py and /path/to/script2.py with the actual paths to your scripts.

The & symbol at the end of each line runs the scripts in the background so that they don't block the execution of other scripts.

Make the shell script executable: Run the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x run_scripts.sh
Add the shell script to the boot process: You can do this by adding a line to the /etc/rc.local file, which is executed at boot time. Open the file in a text editor by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
Add the following line just before the exit 0 line:

bash
Copy code
/path/to/run_scripts.sh &
Replace /path/to/run_scripts.sh with the actual path to your shell script.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Reboot your Raspberry Pi: Run the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
sudo reboot
Your Raspberry Pi should now execute both Python scripts on boot.
